### Mathematics Tripos Courses

#### Statistics (Part I)

The [Statistics](./statistics) course provides foundational statistical concepts and methods through the following chapters:

- [Bayesian Inference](./statistics/chapters/bayesian_inference): Understanding Bayesian probability, prior and posterior distributions, and Bayesian estimation methods
- [Confidence Intervals](./statistics/chapters/confidence_intervals): Construction and interpretation of interval estimates, coverage probability, and confidence levels
- [Digression](./statistics/chapters/digression): Supplementary statistical concepts and additional mathematical foundations
- [Estimation](./statistics/chapters/estimation): Theory of point estimation, properties of estimators, and estimation methods
- [Hypothesis Testing](./statistics/chapters/hypothesis_testing): Framework for statistical testing, test statistics, and decision procedures
- [Linear Models](./statistics/chapters/linear_models): Linear regression analysis, model fitting, and statistical inference in linear models

#### Probability (Part I)

The [Probability](./probability) course covers fundamental probability theory through these key areas:

- [Random Variables](./probability/chapters/random_variables): Discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions
- [Distribution Theory](./probability/chapters/distributions): Common probability distributions and their properties
- [Limit Theorems](./probability/chapters/limit_theorems): Laws of large numbers, central limit theorem

#### Principles of Statistics (Part II)

The [Principles of Statistics](./principles_of_statistics) course advances into more sophisticated statistical theory, building upon the foundations established in Part I:
