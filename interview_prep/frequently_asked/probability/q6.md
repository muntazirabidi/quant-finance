# Question: Properties of Products of Lognormal Random Variables

If $X$ and $Y$ are lognormal random variables, is their product $XY$ lognormally distributed?

## Solutions:

First, recall that if $X$ is lognormally distributed, then by definition:

$\ln(X) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$

Similarly, if $Y$ is lognormally distributed:

$\ln(Y) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$

Let's investigate the product $Z = XY$ by taking its natural logarithm:

$\ln(Z) = \ln(XY)$

Using the properties of logarithms:

$\ln(Z) = \ln(X) + \ln(Y)$

### Key Insight

Here's where we can use a fundamental property of normal distributions: **the sum of two normal random variables is also normally distributed**.

Since $\ln(X)$ and $\ln(Y)$ are each normally distributed:

- $\ln(X) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$
- $\ln(Y) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$

Their sum $\ln(Z) = \ln(X) + \ln(Y)$ will be normally distributed with:

- Mean: $\mu_Z = \mu_X + \mu_Y$
- Variance: $\sigma_Z^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 + 2\rho\sigma_X\sigma_Y$

where $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between $\ln(X)$ and $\ln(Y)$.

### Conclusion

Yes, the product $XY$ is lognormally distributed! This is because:

1. $\ln(XY)$ is normally distributed (as shown above)
2. By definition, if $\ln(Z)$ is normally distributed, then $Z$ is lognormally distributed

Therefore, $Z = XY$ follows a lognormal distribution with parameters:

- Location parameter: $\mu_X + \mu_Y$
- Scale parameter: $\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 + 2\rho\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$

## Important Observations

1. This result holds regardless of whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent or correlated. The correlation between $\ln(X)$ and $\ln(Y)$ simply affects the variance parameter of the resulting distribution.

2. For the special case where $X$ and $Y$ are independent:

   - $\rho = 0$
   - The variance simplifies to: $\sigma_Z^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2$

3. The result generalizes: the product of any number of lognormal random variables is also lognormally distributed.

## Practical Implications

This property is particularly useful in:

- Financial modeling: when calculating the value of portfolios with multiplicative returns
- Signal processing: when analyzing multiplicative noise effects
- Risk assessment: when dealing with cascading multiplicative effects

Understanding that the product remains lognormal helps us predict and analyze the behavior of complex systems where multiplicative effects are present.
