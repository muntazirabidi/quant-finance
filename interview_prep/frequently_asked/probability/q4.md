# Question: Expected Distance from Center of Unit Disk:

A point is chosen randomnly from the unit disk. What is the expected value of the distance between the point and the centre of the disk?

## Solution

The unit disk is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin (0,0). We need to:

1. Select a point randomly from this disk
2. Find the expected value of its distance from the center

### Key Insights

The crucial insight is that while points are chosen uniformly from the disk, the distance from the center follows a different distribution. This is because:

- As we move outward from the center, the circumference increases
- The area of a thin ring at distance $r$ is proportional to $r$
- This affects the probability distribution of distances

### Mathematical Derivation

Let's call the random distance R. To find $E[R]$, we need:

1. The probability density function (PDF) of R
2. To integrate $r × PDF(r)$ from 0 to 1

For a uniformly chosen point:

- The probability of landing in a thin ring at radius r is proportional to the area of that ring
- Area of a ring = $2πr × dr$
- Total area of unit disk = $π$

Therefore:

The PDF of $R$ is:

$$f(r) = \frac{2\pi r}{\pi} = 2r \quad \text{for } 0 \leq r \leq 1$$

Now we can compute E[R]:

$$
E[R] = \int_0^1 r \cdot f(r) \, dr = \int_0^1 r \cdot 2r \, dr = 2\int_0^1 r^2 \, dr
$$

$$
E[R] = 2 \cdot [\frac{r^3}{3}]_0^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

### Intuitive Understanding

The result $E[R] = 2/3$ might seem surprising at first. Why not $1/2$? Here's why:

- If we were choosing poi ts on a line from 0 to 1, the expected value would be $1/2$
- But in a disk, there are more points available at larger radii
- The area grows quadratically with radius
- This "pulls" the expected value up from $1/2$ to $2/3$

We can verify this makes sense:

- The minimum possible distance is 0 (at center)
- The maximum possible distance is 1 (at edge)
- The expected value $2/3$ lies between these, closer to 1 due to the greater area at larger radii
- This matches our intuition about having more points available farther from the center

Therefore, the expected distance from the center of a randomly chosen point in a unit disk is $2/3$ units.

This problem beautifully demonstrates how geometric probabilities can sometimes produce unexpected results, and how understanding the underlying geometry helps make sense of these results.

**Alternative method:**

Let's break this down step by step:

1. In a unit disk, if we choose a point randomly, its coordinates $(X,Y)$ follow certain constraints:

- $X$ and $Y$ must satisfy $X² + Y² ≤ 1$ (the unit disk condition)
- Both $X$ and $Y$ lie in $[-1,1]$

2. Due to uniform selection within the disk:

- $X$ and $Y$ are uniformly distributed within their valid ranges
- However, not all combinations of $(X,Y)$ in $[-1,1] × [-1,1]$ are valid

$D = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$

We need to find $E[D]$. However, directly finding $E[√(X² + Y²)]$ is challenging because:

$X$ and $Y$ aren't independent (they must satisfy $X² + Y² ≤ 1$)
The square root makes direct integration complex

Let's express this formally:

$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\pi} & \text{if } x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
E[D] = \iint_{x^2 + y^2 \leq 1} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} \, dx \, dy
$$

In polar coordinates:

$$
E[D] = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 r \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta
$$

$$
E[D] = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 r^2 \, dr \, d\theta
= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} [\frac{r^3}{3}]_0^1 \, d\theta
= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{3} \, d\theta
= \frac{2}{3}
$$

This alternative solution helps us understand several important concepts:

When we started with uniform $X$ and $Y$, we implicitly had a uniform distribution over area (which is what we wanted). The transformation to polar coordinates reveals why we got the same answer as before:

- The r² term in the integral comes from the Jacobian of the transformation
- This is exactly why we had 2r as our PDF in the first solution

Both methods ultimately reduce to integrating $r²$ because:

- In the first method, it came from the $PDF × r$
- In the second method, it came from the Jacobian
