# The Two-Urn Ball Distribution Problem

## Problem Statement

You have two urns and ten balls: five red and five blue. You must distribute the balls between the two urns according to these rules:

1. Each urn must contain at least one ball
2. After you distribute the balls, one urn will be chosen at random (with probability $\frac{1}{2}$)
3. Then one ball will be drawn randomly from the chosen urn
4. You win if you draw a blue ball

Find the distribution of balls that maximizes your probability of winning.

## Solution Approach

Let's solve this step by step, analyzing different distributions and their corresponding probabilities.

### 1. Probability Calculation

For any distribution of balls, we can calculate the probability of winning using the law of total probability:

$P(\text{win}) = P(\text{urn1}) \cdot P(\text{blue|urn1}) + P(\text{urn2}) \cdot P(\text{blue|urn2})$

where:

- $P(\text{urn1}) = P(\text{urn2}) = \frac{1}{2}$ (random urn selection)
- $P(\text{blue|urn1}) = \frac{\text{blue balls in urn1}}{\text{total balls in urn1}}$
- $P(\text{blue|urn2}) = \frac{\text{blue balls in urn2}}{\text{total balls in urn2}}$

### 2. Analysis of Different Distributions

Let's examine the progression of probabilities as we move balls between urns:

#### Case 1: Even Split

- Urn 1: 5B
- Urn 2: 5R
  $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = \frac{1}{2}$ (50%)

#### Case 2: (4B), (1B + 5R)

- Urn 1: 4B
- Urn 2: 1B + 5R
  $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{12}$ (≈58.3%)

#### Case 3: (3B), (2B + 5R)

- Urn 1: 3B
- Urn 2: 2B + 5R
  $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{8}{14}$ (≈57.1%)

#### Case 4: (2B), (3B + 5R)

- Urn 1: 2B
- Urn 2: 3B + 5R
  $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{11}{16}$ (≈68.8%)

#### Case 5: (1B), (4B + 5R)

- Urn 1: 1B
- Urn 2: 4B + 5R
  $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{13}{18}$ (≈72.2%)

### 3. Key Insight

The optimal strategy is to create one urn with a guaranteed win (100% blue balls) while maximizing the probability of drawing blue in the second urn. This works because:

1. The guaranteed urn provides a "floor" of $\frac{1}{2}$ probability of winning
2. Any non-zero probability from the second urn adds to this floor
3. The more blue balls we can put in the second urn (while maintaining the guarantee in the first urn), the higher our overall probability

### 4. Implementation

Here's a Python solution that systematically finds the best distribution:

```python
def calculate_win_probability(urn1, urn2):
    """Calculate probability of winning for a given distribution."""
    if not urn1 or not urn2:
        return 0.0

    prob_blue_urn1 = urn1.count('B') / len(urn1)
    prob_blue_urn2 = urn2.count('B') / len(urn2)

    return 0.5 * prob_blue_urn1 + 0.5 * prob_blue_urn2

def find_best_distribution(red_balls, blue_balls):
    """Find optimal distribution of balls between urns."""
    from itertools import combinations

    best_prob = 0
    best_dist = None
    all_balls = ['R'] * red_balls + ['B'] * blue_balls
    total_balls = len(all_balls)

    for urn1_size in range(1, total_balls):
        for urn1_balls in combinations(range(total_balls), urn1_size):
            urn1 = [all_balls[i] for i in urn1_balls]
            urn2 = [all_balls[i] for i in range(total_balls)
                   if i not in urn1_balls]

            prob = calculate_win_probability(urn1, urn2)
            if prob > best_prob:
                best_prob = prob
                best_dist = (urn1, urn2)

    return best_dist, best_prob
```

### 5. Conclusion

The optimal distribution is:

- Urn 1: One blue ball (1B)
- Urn 2: Four blue balls and five red balls (4B + 5R)

This gives us a winning probability of $\frac{13}{18}$ (approximately 72.2%), which is significantly better than the intuitive even split that gives only 50%.

This problem demonstrates how mathematical analysis can reveal counterintuitive optimal strategies in probability problems. The key is recognizing that we can leverage the guaranteed win in one urn while maximizing our chances in the second urn.
