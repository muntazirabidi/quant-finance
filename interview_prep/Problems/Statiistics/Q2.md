Let's derive the general form for moments of a normal distribution and then solve for the second moment using two different approaches.

For a random variable $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, the $n^{th}$ moment is defined by:

$$
E[X^n] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^n \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

where $f(x)$ is the probability density function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Using the moment generating function (MGF) approach:

$$
M(t) = \exp(\mu t + \frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2})
$$

The $n^{th}$ moment can be found by taking the $n^{th}$ derivative of $M(t)$ at $t=0$:

$$
E[X^n] = M^{(n)}(0)
$$

This leads to the general form through binomial expansion:

$$
E[X^n] = \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} \mu^i E[(X-\mu)^{n-i}]
$$

where $E[(X-\mu)^k]$ is the $k^{th}$ central moment.

## Calculating Second Moment Using General Form

For $n=2$, let's apply the general form:

1. Expand using binomial coefficients:

$$
E[X^2] = \binom{2}{0}\mu^0E[(X-\mu)^2] + \binom{2}{1}\mu^1E[(X-\mu)^1] + \binom{2}{2}\mu^2E[(X-\mu)^0]
$$

2. Substitute values:

   - $\binom{2}{0} = 1$
   - $\binom{2}{1} = 2$
   - $\binom{2}{2} = 1$
   - $E[(X-\mu)^2] = \sigma^2$
   - $E[(X-\mu)^1] = 0$
   - $E[(X-\mu)^0] = 1$

3. Therefore:

$$
E[X^2] = 1\cdot\sigma^2 + 2\mu\cdot0 + 1\cdot\mu^2 = \sigma^2 + \mu^2
$$

## Alternative Derivation for Second Moment

Let's solve this using a more intuitive decomposition approach:

1. Express $X$ in terms of its deviation from mean:

$$
X = \mu + (X-\mu)
$$

2. Square both sides:

$$
X^2 = (\mu + (X-\mu))^2 = \mu^2 + 2\mu(X-\mu) + (X-\mu)^2
$$

3. Take expectation:

$$
E[X^2] = E[\mu^2 + 2\mu(X-\mu) + (X-\mu)^2]
$$

4. Using linearity of expectation:

$$
E[X^2] = \mu^2 + 2\mu E[X-\mu] + E[(X-\mu)^2]
$$

5. Simplify using:
   - $E[X-\mu] = 0$ (definition of mean)
   - $E[(X-\mu)^2] = \sigma^2$ (definition of variance)

Therefore:

$$
E[X^2] = \mu^2 + \sigma^2
$$

This second approach provides more intuition about how the second moment naturally decomposes into the square of the mean plus the variance.

For a normal distribution $X \sim N(μ, σ²)$, the moments have interesting patterns. Let me create a table that shows both types of moments:

### Table of Moments for Normal Distribution $X \sim N(μ, σ²)$

| Order ($n$) | Central Moments $E[(X-μ)ⁿ]$ |              Non-Central Moments $E[Xⁿ]$              |
| :---------: | :-------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|      1      |              0              |                           μ                           |
|      2      |             σ²              |                        μ² + σ²                        |
|      3      |              0              |                       μ³ + 3μσ²                       |
|      4      |             3σ⁴             |                   μ⁴ + 6μ²σ² + 3σ⁴                    |
|      5      |              0              |                  μ⁵ + 10μ³σ² + 15μσ⁴                  |
|      6      |            15σ⁶             |              μ⁶ + 15μ⁴σ² + 45μ²σ⁴ + 15σ⁶              |
|      7      |              0              |            μ⁷ + 21μ⁵σ² + 105μ³σ⁴ + 105μσ⁶             |
|      8      |            105σ⁸            |        μ⁸ + 28μ⁶σ² + 210μ⁴σ⁴ + 420μ²σ⁶ + 105σ⁸        |
|      9      |              0              |       μ⁹ + 36μ⁷σ² + 378μ⁵σ⁴ + 1260μ³σ⁶ + 945μσ⁸       |
|     10      |           945σ¹⁰            | μ¹⁰ + 45μ⁸σ² + 630μ⁶σ⁴ + 3150μ⁴σ⁶ + 4725μ²σ⁸ + 945σ¹⁰ |

Some important patterns to note in this table:

1. Central Moments:

   - All odd central moments are zero
   - Even central moments follow a pattern involving factorials and powers of σ
   - The 2nth central moment is σ²ⁿ times (2n-1)!!

2. Non-Central Moments:
   - These are more complex as they involve both μ and σ
   - They can be derived using binomial expansion and the central moments
   - The coefficients follow a systematic pattern related to combinations and partitions
