Let me help solve this fascinating problem in two different ways. First, let's solve it using logarithms and calculus:

# Solution 1: Using Logarithms and Calculus

We want to determine which is larger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$

Since both expressions are positive, we can take $\ln$ of both sides without changing their relative order:

$\ln(e^\pi) \lesseqgtr \ln(\pi^e)$

Using the properties of logarithms:

- Left side: $\ln(e^\pi) = \pi\ln(e) = \pi$
- Right side: $\ln(\pi^e) = e\ln(\pi)$

Therefore, our comparison becomes:
$\pi \lesseqgtr e\ln(\pi)$

Since $\pi \approx 3.14159$ and $e\ln(\pi) \approx 2.71828 \times 1.14472 \approx 3.11063$:

$\pi > e\ln(\pi)$

Therefore, $e^\pi > \pi^e$

# Solution 2: Using Analysis of $\frac{\ln(x)}{x}$

Let's approach this differently by considering the ratio of these expressions:

$\frac{e^\pi}{\pi^e} \lesseqgtr 1$

Taking $\ln$ of both sides:

$\ln(\frac{e^\pi}{\pi^e}) \lesseqgtr \ln(1) = 0$

$\pi - e\ln(\pi) \lesseqgtr 0$

This is equivalent to comparing:

$\frac{\ln(\pi)}{\pi} \lesseqgtr \frac{1}{e}$

Now we can analyze the function $f(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x}$:

1. Taking the derivative:
   $f'(x) = \frac{1-\ln(x)}{x^2}$

2. At $x = e$:
   $f'(e) = \frac{1-\ln(e)}{e^2} = 0$

3. At $x = \pi$:
   Since $\pi > e$, we know $\ln(\pi) > 1$
   Therefore $f'(\pi) < 0$

4. This means $f(x)$ achieves its maximum at $x = e$ and is decreasing for $x > e$

5. Since $\pi > e$:
   $\frac{\ln(\pi)}{\pi} < \frac{\ln(e)}{e} = \frac{1}{e}$

Therefore, $\pi - e\ln(\pi) > 0$, which means $e^\pi > \pi^e$

Both solutions arrive at the same conclusion through different paths, showcasing the beauty and interconnectedness of mathematical concepts. The second solution provides deeper insight into why this relationship holds true by analyzing the behavior of a related function.

The numerical values also support our conclusion:

- $e^\pi \approx 23.14$
- $\pi^e \approx 22.46$
