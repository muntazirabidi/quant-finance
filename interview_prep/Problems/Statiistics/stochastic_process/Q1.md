# The Ball Coloring Problem:

## Problem Statement

Consider a box containing $n$ balls of $n$ different colors. At each step, you randomly select a pair of balls, repaint the first to match the second, and return both balls to the box. What is the expected number of steps until all balls are the same color?

## Solution

### Key Insight: Reversing Time and Color Operations

Let's formulate this more precisely. Define two types of operations:

1. $P(i,j)$: Paint ball $i$ the color of ball $j$
2. $C(i,j)$: Paint all balls of color $i$ to color $j$

Initially, ball $i$ has color $i$ for all $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$.

### The Fundamental Symmetry

The crucial observation is that performing a sequence of $P$ operations:

$P(i_1,j_1), P(i_2,j_2), \ldots, P(i_T,j_T)$

produces the same final coloring as performing the reversed sequence of $C$ operations:

$C(i_T,j_T), C(i_{T-1},j_{T-1}), \ldots, C(i_1,j_1)$

### Example

Consider $n=4$ balls with initial state $[1,2,3,4]$. Let's compare:

P-process sequence:

```
[1,2,3,4] →P(1,2) [2,2,3,4] →P(2,4) [2,4,3,4] →P(3,1) [2,4,2,4] →P(4,1) [2,4,2,2]
```

Reversed C-process sequence:

```
[1,2,3,4] →C(4,1) [1,2,3,1] →C(3,1) [1,2,1,1] →C(2,4) [1,4,1,1] →C(1,2) [2,4,2,2]
```

### Mathematical Analysis

In the C-process:

1. When $k$ colors remain, the probability of reducing to $k-1$ colors is $\frac{k(k-1)}{n(n-1)}$
2. Therefore, the expected time to reduce from $k$ to $k-1$ colors is $\frac{n(n-1)}{k(k-1)}$
3. The total expected time is:

$\mathbb{E}(\tau) = \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{n(n-1)}{k(k-1)}$

$= n(n-1)\sum_{k=2}^n (\frac{1}{k-1} - \frac{1}{k})$

$= n(n-1)(1 - \frac{1}{n})$

$= (n-1)^2$

### Why This Works

The key insights that make this solution elegant:

1. The symmetry between painting balls ($P$) and painting colors ($C$)
2. The time reversal making the process easier to analyze
3. Breaking down the complex Markov chain into a sequence of geometric random variables

The final answer $(n-1)^2$ aligns with intuition: we need to eliminate $n-1$ colors, and the process becomes progressively more difficult as fewer distinct colors remain.

This solution demonstrates the power of finding the right perspective - transforming a complex stochastic process into a sequence of independent geometric random variables through clever reformulation.

Let me help solve this problem using conditional probability and explain each step carefully.

# Analyzing Ball Coloring Using Conditional Probability

## Setup

Let's define our problem space carefully:

- We have $n$ balls, initially each with a unique color
- At each step, we randomly pick two balls $(i,j)$ and paint ball $i$ the color of ball $j$
- Let's track the number of distinct colors remaining at each step

## Key Observation

Let's denote:

- $X_t$ as the number of distinct colors after $t$ steps
- Initially, $X_0 = n$
- We want to find $\mathbb{E}[T]$ where $T = \min\{t: X_t = 1\}$

## Conditional Probability Approach

Let's break this down by analyzing what happens at each step.

1. First, let's understand the transition probabilities:
   When we have $k$ distinct colors:

   - Let $n_i$ be the number of balls of color $i$
   - $\sum_{i=1}^k n_i = n$ (total number of balls)

2. For a color reduction to occur:

   - We must pick a ball of any color $i$ (with $n_i$ balls)
   - And pick a ball of a different color $j$ (with $n_j$ balls)
   - The probability is: $\frac{n_i}{n} \cdot \frac{n_j}{n-1}$

3. Due to symmetry, all colors with the same count are equivalent:

   - Let's say we have $k$ colors remaining
   - The expected value law tells us:
     $\mathbb{E}[T] = \mathbb{E}[T|X_0 = n] = \sum_{k=2}^n \mathbb{E}[\text{time spent with k colors}]$

4. For each state with $k$ colors:

   - Let $p_k$ be the probability of reducing colors when at $k$ colors
   - $p_k = \frac{k(k-1)}{n(n-1)}$ (after considering all possible pairs)
   - The time spent at $k$ colors follows a geometric distribution with parameter $p_k$
   - Expected time = $\frac{1}{p_k} = \frac{n(n-1)}{k(k-1)}$

5. Therefore:
   $\mathbb{E}[T] = \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{n(n-1)}{k(k-1)}$

   $= n(n-1)\sum_{k=2}^n (\frac{1}{k-1} - \frac{1}{k})$

   $= n(n-1)(1 - \frac{1}{n})$

   $= (n-1)^2$

## Key Insights

This approach helps us understand why the answer is $(n-1)^2$:

1. The process must eliminate $n-1$ colors
2. Each reduction becomes harder as we have fewer colors
3. The geometric distribution naturally captures the "waiting time" at each stage
4. The telescoping sum shows how the process gradually converges

The conditional probability approach makes clear that this is a Markov chain where:

- States represent the number of distinct colors
- Transitions depend only on the current state
- The process is absorbing, with state 1 being the absorbing state

This gives us a more intuitive understanding of why the expected time is quadratic in $n$: we need to make $n-1$ successful color reductions, and each reduction becomes progressively more difficult due to the decreasing probability of choosing balls of different colors.
