# Question:

## Problem Statement

We need to find $E(X⁴)$ where $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $σ²$.

## Approach 1: Integration by Parts

For a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ², the probability density function is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Therefore:

$$E(X^4) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^4 \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx$$

### Step 1: Setting up Integration by Parts

Let's use the substitution:
$$u = x^3 \quad \text{and} \quad dv = xe^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx$$

This gives us:
$$du = 3x^2dx \quad \text{and} \quad v = -\sigma^2e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

### Step 2: Applying the Formula

Using $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$:

$$
\begin{align*}
E(X^4) &= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^4e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx \\
&= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\left[-\sigma^2x^3e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right]_{-\infty}^{\infty} + \frac{3\sigma^2}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx
\end{align*}
$$

### Step 3: Evaluating the Result

The first term evaluates to 0 at both limits. For the second integral, we can use the fact that:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx = \sigma^3\sqrt{2\pi}$$

Therefore:

$$E(X^4) = 3\sigma^4$$

## Approach 2: Moment Generating Function

The moment generating function (MGF) provides an elegant alternative approach.

### Step 1: Recall MGF Properties

For a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ², the MGF is:
$$M_X(t) = e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$$

The fourth moment can be found by evaluating the fourth derivative at t = 0:
$$E(X^4) = \left.\frac{d^4}{dt^4}M_X(t)\right|_{t=0}$$

### Step 2: Taking Derivatives

Let's find successive derivatives:

1. First derivative:
   $$M_X'(t) = \sigma^2t e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$$

2. Second derivative:
   $$M_X''(t) = \sigma^2e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}} + \sigma^4t^2e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$$

3. Third derivative:
   $$M_X'''(t) = 3\sigma^4te^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}} + \sigma^6t^3e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$$

4. Fourth derivative:
   $$M_X^{(4)}(t) = (3\sigma^4 + 6\sigma^6t^2 + \sigma^8t^4)e^{\frac{\sigma^2t^2}{2}}$$

### Step 3: Evaluating at t = 0

When we evaluate the fourth derivative at $t = 0:$
$$E(X^4) = M_X^{(4)}(0) = 3\sigma^4$$

## Understanding the Result

The fact that $E(X⁴) = 3σ⁴$ is a fundamental result for normal distributions. We can understand this result in several ways:

1. Comparison with variance:

   - Since $σ² = E(X²)$, we can see that $E(X⁴) = 3[E(X²)]²$
   - This relationship is characteristic of normal distributions

2. Standardization perspective:

   - For a standard normal $(σ = 1), E(X⁴) = 3$
   - For general σ, multiply by σ⁴ due to scaling properties

3. Physical interpretation:
   - The fourth moment relates to the "kurtosis" of the distribution
   - For normal distributions, this gives rise to the famous "excess kurtosis = 0" property

## Verification

We can verify this result using:

1. Numerical integration
2. Monte Carlo simulation
3. The known relationship to kurtosis

Each method will confirm that $E(X⁴) = 3σ⁴$ for a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $σ²$.
