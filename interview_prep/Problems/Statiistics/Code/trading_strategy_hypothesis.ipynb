    "# Analyzing Trading Strategy Performance: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a detailed analysis of testing whether a trading strategy genuinely outperforms the market, using the statistical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've developed a momentum trading strategy for the S&P 500. You want to determine if your strategy truly generates excess returns (alpha) above the market benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up our specific scenario:\n",
    "- Market average annual return: 8% ($\\theta_0 = 0.08$)\n",
    "- Target strategy return: 12% ($\\theta_1 = 0.12$)\n",
    "- Known annual market volatility: 15% ($\\sigma_0 = 0.15$)\n",
    "- Significance level: 5% ($\\alpha = 0.05$)\n",
    "- Desired power: 90% (probability of detecting true outperformance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how this analysis works and what insights it provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1: Sample Size Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we determine how many trading days we need to observe to have sufficient statistical power. The calculation considers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The effect size we want to detect (4% difference in returns)\n",
    "2. The known volatility (15% annually)\n",
    "3. Our desired confidence level (95%) and power (90%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use our analyzer to calculate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "analyzer = TradingStrategyAnalyzer()\n",
    "required_days = analyzer.calculate_required_sample_size()\n",
    "print(f\"Required trading days: {required_days}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would tell us the minimum trading period needed for reliable results. For our parameters, it's typically around 200-250 trading days (approximately one year), which makes intuitive sense given the noise in financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2: Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have sufficient data, we can analyze the strategy's performance. The analyzer performs several key tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Significance Testing**:\n",
    "   - Tests if excess returns are significantly different from zero\n",
    "   - Accounts for both the magnitude and consistency of outperformance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Risk-Adjusted Performance**:\n",
    "   - Calculates Sharpe ratio to measure risk-adjusted returns\n",
    "   - Considers the volatility of excess returns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Power Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Verifies if we have sufficient data for reliable conclusions\n",
    "   - Helps prevent false negatives in strategy evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3: Practical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simulate a strategy and analyze its performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create analyzer with our parameters\n",
    "analyzer = TradingStrategyAnalyzer(\n",
    "    market_return=0.08,    # 8% annual market return\n",
    "    target_return=0.12,    # 12% target return\n",
    "    volatility=0.15,       # 15% annual volatility\n",
    "    significance_level=0.05,\n",
    "    power=0.90\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simulate one year of trading\n",
    "trading_days = 252\n",
    "strategy_returns, market_returns = analyzer.simulate_strategy_performance(trading_days)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze the results\n",
    "results = analyzer.analyze_strategy_returns(strategy_returns, market_returns)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis provides several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Significance**: If the p-value < 0.05, we have strong evidence that the strategy's outperformance is not due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Economic Significance**: The mean excess return tells us if the outperformance is economically meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk Assessment**: The Sharpe ratio helps us understand if the excess returns justify the additional risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reliability Check**: The achieved power tells us if we have enough data to make reliable conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying this analysis in practice, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction Costs**: The analysis should include trading costs and slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Varying Risk**: Market volatility changes over time; consider using rolling windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Market Conditions**: Strategy performance might vary across different market regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Assumptions**: The normality assumption might not hold; consider robust statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statistical framework provides a rigorous way to evaluate trading strategies, helping distinguish genuine alpha from lucky outcomes. It combines financial theory with statistical rigor to make more informed investment decisions."

    "## Key Rules of Thumb for Financial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sample Size Quick Estimates\n",
    "Think of this simple framework: \"16-64-256\" rule for sample size estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To detect a \"large\" effect (like 20% difference): ~16 months of data\n",
    "- To detect a \"medium\" effect (like 10% difference): ~64 months of data\n",
    "- To detect a \"small\" effect (like 5% difference): ~256 months of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition here comes from the fact that to halve the detectable effect size, you need to quadruple your sample size.\n",
    "### 2. Volatility Scaling\n",
    "Remember the \"Square Root of Time\" rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daily to Annual volatility: multiply by √252\n",
    "- Monthly to Annual volatility: multiply by √12\n",
    "- Weekly to Annual volatility: multiply by √52\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if daily volatility is 1%, annual volatility is approximately:\n",
    "1% × √252 ≈ 16%\n",
    "### 3. Sharpe Ratio and Sample Size\n",
    "A quick way to estimate required sample size for Sharpe ratio validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a Sharpe ratio of 1.0, you need about 3 years of data\n",
    "- For a Sharpe ratio of 0.5, you need about 12 years of data\n",
    "- For a Sharpe ratio of 0.25, you need about 48 years of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition: The required number of years ≈ 16/(Sharpe Ratio)²\n",
    "### 4. Statistical Significance\n",
    "For quick mental math in interviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 standard deviations ≈ 95% confidence\n",
    "- 3 standard deviations ≈ 99% confidence\n",
    "- Each standard deviation is about 0.67 on a Sharpe ratio scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Power Analysis Shortcut\n",
    "Remember the \"4-16-64\" rule for detecting differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To detect 4% difference: need about 64 months\n",
    "- To detect 8% difference: need about 16 months\n",
    "- To detect 16% difference: need about 4 months\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes typical market volatility (15-20% annually) and standard statistical significance levels."

    "## Interview Example\n",
    "**Interviewer:** \"How long would you need to test a strategy that claims to generate 12% returns versus a market return of 8%?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your response could be:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, we're looking at a 4% difference. Given typical market volatility of about 15% annually, I can use the rule of thumb that says detecting a 4% difference requires about 64 months of data. This makes intuitive sense because market noise (15% volatility) is much larger than our signal (4% excess return), so we need several years of data to confidently detect the outperformance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application Example**\n",

    "- Effect size = (15% - 10%)/20% = 0.25 (medium-large effect)\n",
