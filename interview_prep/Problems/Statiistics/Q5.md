# Question: Normal Distribution Parameter Estimation - Sampling Distributions

Suppose $Y \sim \text{Normal}(\mu,\sigma^2)$. Now, $10^6$ people each draw 1000 samples from this distribution. Let $i$ denote the $i$th person. Each person estimates the parameters of the normal distribution $\hat{\mu}_i$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$ using their samples $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_{1000}$.

1. How should they estimate these parameters?
2. If you draw a histogram of the $10^6$ estimates of $\hat{\mu}_i$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$, what would their distributions be?
3. How would you prove the exact sampling distribution of $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$?

## Solution

### 1. Parameter Estimation

For each person $i$, given their samples $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_{1000}$:

The maximum likelihood estimator (and sample mean) for $\mu$ is:

$\hat{\mu}_i = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{j=1}^{1000} Y_j$

For $\sigma^2$, while the maximum likelihood estimator is:

$\hat{\sigma}^2_{i,MLE} = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{j=1}^{1000} (Y_j - \hat{\mu}_i)^2$

We typically use the unbiased estimator:

$\hat{\sigma}^2_i = \frac{1}{999}\sum_{j=1}^{1000} (Y_j - \hat{\mu}_i)^2$

### 2. Sampling Distributions

For $\hat{\mu}_i$:
By the Central Limit Theorem, since each estimate is based on 1000 independent and identically distributed samples:

$\hat{\mu}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{1000})$

Therefore, the histogram of the million estimates of $\mu$ will show a normal distribution centered at the true $\mu$ with variance $\sigma^2/1000$.

For $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$:
The sampling distribution follows a scaled chi-squared distribution:

$\frac{(n-1)\hat{\sigma}^2_i}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2(n-1)$

where $n = 1000$ in this case.

### 3. Proof of $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$ Sampling Distribution

To prove the sampling distribution of $\hat{\sigma}^2_i$, we follow these steps:

1. First, for normal samples:

   $\frac{Y_j - \mu}{\sigma} \sim \text{N}(0,1)$

2. Therefore:

   $(\frac{Y_j - \mu}{\sigma})^2 \sim \chi^2(1)$

3. A key property of normal distributions is that $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ are independent.

4. We can then show:

   $\frac{(n-1)\hat{\sigma}^2_i}{\sigma^2} = \sum_{j=1}^n (\frac{Y_j - \hat{\mu}_i}{\sigma})^2 \sim \chi^2(n-1)$

The histogram of the million estimates of $\sigma^2$ will therefore follow a scaled and shifted chi-squared distribution with 999 degrees of freedom. Due to the large number of degrees of freedom, this will appear approximately normal but with a slight right skew.

### Key Insights

1. While both estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, their finite-sample distributions differ significantly.

2. The sampling distribution of $\hat{\mu}$ is exactly normal, while that of $\hat{\sigma}^2$ follows a chi-squared distribution.

3. This difference has important implications for inference and confidence interval construction for variance parameters.
