# Question

> Suppose we toss a fair coin and let N denote the number os possess until we get a head what is $E(N)$ and $Var(N)$

To find the expected value $E(N)$ and the variance $Var(N)$ for the number of tosses until we get a head when tossing a fair coin, we recognize that this follows a geometric distribution with success probability $p = 0.5$.

### Expected Value $E(N) $:

The expected value for a geometric distribution is given by $E(N) = \frac{1}{p}$. For a fair coin ($ p = 0.5$):

$$
E(N) = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2
$$

### Variance $Var(N)$:

The variance for a geometric distribution is given by $Var(N) = \frac{1 - p}{p^2}$. For a fair coin $( p = 0.5$):

$$
Var(N) = \frac{1 - 0.5}{0.5^2} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
$$

### Verification:

We verified the results using both summation of series and recursive approaches. The key steps include:

1. **Summation Approach**:

   - For $E(N)$, we used the series sum $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot (0.5)^k$ and derived it using calculus.
   - For $E(N^2)$, we used the series sum $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^2 \cdot (0.5)^k$ and derived it using calculus, leading to $Var(N) = E(N^2) - [E(N)]^2$.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - For $E(N)$, we set up the equation $E = 0.5 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot (1 + E)$ and solved for $E$.
   - For $E(N^2)$, we set up the equation $V = 0.5 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot E[(1 + N')^2]$ and solved for $V$, leading to the variance calculation.

Both methods confirmed that $E(N) = 2$ and $Var(N) = 2$.

### Final Answer

The expected value is $\boxed{2}$ and the variance is $\boxed{2}$.
