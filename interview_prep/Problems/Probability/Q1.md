# Question:

> We play a game. I pick a number $n$ fro 1 to 100 if you guess correctly I pay you n and zero otherwise. How much would you pay to play the game?

## Solution

The problem can be approached using game theory, considering an adversarial opponent who aims to minimize your expected payout. Here's the key analysis:

1. **Game-Theoretic Strategy**:

   - To ensure the expected payout is independent of the opponent's choice, you should pick each number $k$ with probability proportional to $\frac{1}{k}$. This forms a mixed strategy where the probability of picking $k$ is:
     $$
       p*k = \frac{\frac{1}{k}}{\sum*{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j}}
     $$
   - The harmonic number $H*{100} = \sum*{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j} \approx 5.187$.

2. **Expected Payout**:

   - The expected payout under this strategy is constant for any number the opponent picks:
     $$
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{1}{H_{100}} \approx \frac{1}{5.187} \approx 0.1927
     $$

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The value of the game, representing the maximum amount you should pay to play, is the reciprocal of the 100th harmonic number.

Thus, the final answer is$\boxed{\frac{1}{\sum\_{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j}}}$.

## Lets discuss what if you receive the number squared:

To analyze the game where you receive \( n^2 \) dollars if you guess the correct number \( n \) (and zero otherwise), we need to determine the optimal strategy and expected value in this adversarial setup. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### **1. Game-Theoretic Strategy**

In this adversarial game:

- **You (Player 1)** choose a number $k$ probabilistically to maximize your payout.
- **The opponent (Player 2)** chooses a hidden number $n$ to minimize your payout.

To ensure the opponent is indifferent to their choice (i.e., your expected payout is constant for any $n $), you must use a **mixed strategy** where the probability of picking $k$, $p\*k$, satisfies:

$$
p_k \cdot k^2 = \text{constant for all } k.
$$

This leads to probabilities proportional to $\frac{1}{k^2}$:

$$
p_k = \frac{\frac{1}{k^2}}{\sum*{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j^2}}.
$$

---

### **2. Expected Value Calculation**

The expected payout is constant for any $n$ the opponent picks:

$$
\text{Expected Payout} = p*n \cdot n^2 = \frac{\frac{1}{n^2}}{\sum*{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j^2}} \cdot n^2 = \frac{1}{\sum\_{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j^2}}.
$$

---

### **3. Key Numerical Values**

- The sum $\sum*{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j^2}$ converges to approximately $1.6349$.  
  (The infinite sum $\sum*{j=1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.6449$; the finite sum up to 100 is slightly smaller.)
- The expected value of the game is:
  $$
   \text{Expected Value} = \frac{1}{1.6349} \approx 0.611 \text{ dollars}.
  $$

---

### **4. Comparison to the Original Game**

- **Original game (payout = $n$)**: Expected value $\approx 0.193$.  
  Strategy: $p_k \propto \frac{1}{k}$.
- **Squared payout (payout = $n^2$)**: Expected value $\approx 0.611$.  
  Strategy: $p_k \propto \frac{1}{k^2}$.

The higher expected value reflects the larger payouts for high $n$, despite their lower selection probability.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

You should pay no more than the game’s value to ensure a non-negative expected profit. The amount is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{\sum\_{j=1}^{100} \frac{1}{j^2}}} \approx 0.61 \text{ dollars}.
$$

## Do you think many people would play this game well?

**Answer:**  
Most people would **not** play this game well, especially in its adversarial form. Here's why:

---

### **1. Counterintuitive Strategy**

- **Optimal play** requires choosing numbers with probabilities _inversely proportional_ to their payouts (e.g., $p_k \propto 1/k$ for payout $n$, or $p_k \propto 1/k^2$ for payout $n^2$).
- **Human intuition** often favors "greedy" strategies, like guessing high numbers (e.g., 100) to chase the largest payout, even though this dramatically reduces the probability of winning.
- Example: In the original game ($\text{payout} = n $), people might fixate on the $100 reward but fail to realize that guessing 100 only gives a 1% chance of winning. The optimal strategy, however, involves guessing low numbers (e.g., 1) _more frequently_.

---

### **2. Misunderstanding Adversarial Dynamics**

- **Naive assumption**: Many players treat the game as a "fair" lottery, assuming the hidden number $n$is chosen uniformly at random.
  - This leads to strategies like uniform guessing ($p_k = 1/100$), which gives an expected payout of $50.5 (for $n$) or ~$3383 (for $n^2$)—**but only if the opponent isn’t adversarial**.
- **Reality**: The opponent actively tries to minimize your payout. If you guess uniformly, they will always pick $n = 1$, reducing your expected payout to $0.01 (original game) or $0.0001 (squared game).

---

### **3. Cognitive Biases**

- **Overconfidence**: People overestimate their ability to "outsmart" the game, often doubling down on high-risk guesses (e.g., 100).
- **Probability neglect**: Players focus on the _magnitude_ of payouts ($n$ or $n^2$) rather than the vanishingly small probabilities of guessing correctly.
- **Loss aversion**: Even if players recognize the low probability of winning, they might avoid "wasting" guesses on low-payout numbers (e.g., 1), even though these are critical for balancing the strategy.

---

### **4. Mathematical Complexity**

- The optimal strategy requires knowledge of **harmonic series** ($\sum 1/k$) or **Riemann zeta function** ($\sum 1/k^2$), which are non-trivial for non-experts.
- Example: Calculating $\sum_{k=1}^{100} 1/k \approx 5.187$ or $\sum_{k=1}^{100} 1/k^2 \approx 1.635$ is unintuitive without formal training.

---

### **5. Empirical Evidence**

- In experimental game theory, participants often fail to implement mixed strategies correctly. They:
  - **Underweight low-probability/high-payout options** (e.g., rarely guessing 100 despite its payout),
  - **Overweight mid-range numbers** due to anchoring bias,
  - **Struggle with true randomization**, introducing patterns that adversaries can exploit.

---

### **6. Risk Aversion vs. Rational Play**

- Even if players grasp the theory, they might prefer "safer" strategies (e.g., guessing mid-range numbers) to avoid the frustration of frequent losses, even though this guarantees a lower expected payout.

---

### **Final Answer**

The average person would perform **poorly** in this game due to:

1. Overestimating high-payout numbers,
2. Ignoring the adversarial nature of the opponent,
3. Lacking the mathematical tools to derive the optimal strategy.

Only those trained in game theory or probability would recognize the need for a mixed strategy with probabilities weighted inversely to payouts. For everyone else, the game is a psychological trap.

**Bottom Line:**  
Unless explicitly taught the counterintuitive $p_k \propto 1/k$ or $1/k^2$ strategy, most people would play suboptimally. The game’s value lies in exploiting human biases.

$\boxed{\text{No, most people would not play this game well.}}$

## If you charge an incorrect price, in what sense would you lose money?

Charging an incorrect price in this game leads to financial losses depending on whether the price is set **too low** or **too high** relative to the game's _expected value_. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **1. Charging Too Low (Below Expected Value)**

- **Problem**: If you charge less than the game’s expected value (e.g., charging $0.10 when the game’s value is $0.19 for payout $n$, or $0.50 when it’s $0.61 for payout $n^2$), players will exploit the discrepancy.
- **Outcome**:
  - Over many plays, the law of large numbers ensures that your **average payout per game** will converge to the expected value.
  - Example: For the original game ($\text{EV} \approx \$0.19$), charging $0.10 per play means you lose **\$0.09 per play on average**.
  - For the squared payout ($\text{EV} \approx \$0.61$), charging $0.50 per play means losing **\$0.11 per play**.
- **Result**: You hemorrhage money over time, as total revenue ($\text{price} \times \text{number of plays}$) fails to cover total payouts.

---

### **2. Charging Too High (Above Expected Value)**

- **Problem**: If you charge more than the game’s value (e.g., $1.00 for the original game or $2.00 for the squared game), rational players will refuse to participate.
- **Outcome**:
  - Players recognize that the cost to play exceeds the expected reward, leading to **zero participation**.
  - If forced to operate the game (e.g., renting a booth, staffing), you incur **fixed costs without revenue**, leading to losses.
- **Result**: While there’s no direct payout loss, operational costs or opportunity costs (e.g., time, resources) create financial drain.

---

### **3. The Adversarial Edge**

- **Critical Insight**: This is not a "fair" lottery. If you misprice the game, an adversarial opponent (e.g., a casino patron) will:
  - **Exploit underpricing**: Play repeatedly to drain your funds.
  - **Avoid overpricing**: Boycott the game entirely.
- Example: If you charge $0.15 for the original game ($\text{EV} = \$0.19$), savvy players will play constantly, knowing they gain **\$0.04 per play on average**.

---

### **4. The Role of Strategy**

- **Optimal Pricing**: The correct price is the game’s **value**, derived from its expected payout under adversarial play ($\frac{1}{H\_{100}} \approx \$0.19$for $n$, $\frac{1}{\sum 1/k^2} \approx \$0.61$ for $n^2$).
- **Mispricing Risk**: Deviating from this price guarantees losses:
  - Underpricing → Losses from excessive payouts.
  - Overpricing → Losses from idle operations.

---

### **5. Real-World Analogues**

- **Casinos**: Slot machines and games are priced (via odds/house edge) to ensure long-term profit. Mispricing risks bankruptcy.
- **Insurance**: Premiums are set based on actuarial expected losses. Underpricing leads to insolvency; overpricing loses customers.

---

### **Final Answer**

You lose money if you charge an incorrect price because:

1. **Underpricing** guarantees a per-play loss as payouts exceed revenue.
2. **Overpricing** risks operational losses due to lack of participation.

The only sustainable price is the game’s **theoretical value**, balancing participation and profitability.

$\boxed{\text{Charging below the game's expected value leads to guaranteed losses; charging above risks operational losses.}}$
